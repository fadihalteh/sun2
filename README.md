</p>


Real-time embedded **C++17** software for solar tracking using a **3-RRS Stewart-type parallel mechanism** on **Raspberry Pi / Linux**.

This project implements an event-driven pipeline in which camera frames are delivered through callbacks, processed by vision and control modules, converted into platform motion through inverse kinematics, and safely applied to three actuators through a hardware abstraction layer. The runtime is structured around blocking waits, callback-driven stage transitions, bounded queues, and modular components so the software remains responsive, maintainable, testable, and reproducible.

## Project Overview

The **Solar Stewart Tracker** is a Linux userspace realtime embedded system that:

- acquires camera frames from a camera backend
- detects the sun position using image processing
- computes tracking corrections
- converts desired motion into **3-RRS inverse kinematics**
- applies safety shaping before actuation
- drives three servo outputs through a PCA9685 PWM controller

The design goal is not only functional tracking, but tracking implemented in a way that is:

- **event-driven**
- **responsive**
- **modular**
- **testable**
- **reproducible**
- **safe for hardware control**

The main software path is:

**Camera → SunTracker → Controller → ManualImuCoordinator → Kinematics3RRS → ActuatorManager → ServoDriver**

---

## Key Features

- **Realtime event-driven processing**
  - callback-based frame delivery
  - blocking worker threads
  - no busy-wait control loop in the processing pipeline
  - no sleep-based timing in the control path

- **Modular C++17 architecture**
  - `SystemManager` orchestrates the runtime pipeline
  - hardware-facing and processing modules are separated by clear interfaces
  - optional backends and UI layers do not change the core architecture

- **Multiple build and use modes**
  - Linux / Raspberry Pi execution
  - software-only path with simulated camera input
  - headless CLI application
  - optional Qt GUI target

- **Safety-oriented actuation path**
  - actuator clamping
  - optional slew/rate limiting
  - neutral / park behaviour on start and stop
  - explicit handling of low-confidence tracking conditions
  - fault-driven suppression of invalid actuation commands

- **Engineering evidence built into the repository**
  - CMake-based build
  - CTest-integrated automated tests

## System Architecture

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/Threaded Event-Driven System Architecture Diagram.png" alt="System Architecture" width="900">
</p>

The repository is organised around a staged runtime pipeline.

### Core Modules

- **ICamera**  
  Abstract camera interface used by the system.

- **LibcameraPublisher**  
  Raspberry Pi / Linux camera backend when `libcamera` is available.

- **SimulatedPublisher**  
  Fallback or simulation camera backend.

- **SystemManager**  
  Top-level orchestrator for state, queues, callbacks, and worker threads.

- **SunTracker**  
  Vision module that finds the bright target and estimates sun position.

- **Controller**  
  Converts tracking error into platform tilt/pan setpoints.

- **ManualImuCoordinator**  
  Coordinates manual input ownership and optional IMU-based correction.

- **Kinematics3RRS**  
  Converts platform setpoints into actuator-space commands.

- **ActuatorManager**  
  Safety shaping layer for command limiting.

- **ServoDriver**  
  Final actuator output layer.

- **LatencyMonitor**  
  Measures timing across the userspace pipeline.

### Threading Model

The runtime is structured as a **multi-threaded, event-driven system** where **blocking I/O is used to wake up threads**, and callbacks propagate data through the processing pipeline.

Separate execution contexts are used for:

- **camera / backend context**: frame acquisition and callback delivery
- **control thread**: vision, control, coordination, and kinematics
- **actuator thread**: safety filtering and output application
- **main / event loop**: application lifecycle and optional UI / event handling

### Queue Policy

Inter-stage communication uses bounded queues with a freshest-data policy:

- **frame queue capacity:** 1
- **command queue capacity:** 1

This avoids stale backlog and prioritises current data over historical frames.

## Circuit Diagram

<p align="center">
  <img src="diagrams/circuit_diagram.png" alt="Circuit Diagram" width="900">
</p>

The hardware setup connects:

- camera through a libcamera-compatible interface
- PCA9685 PWM driver over I2C
- ADS1115 over I2C for manual input
- MPU6050 over I2C for feedback
- three servo motors
- Raspberry Pi acting as the central controller

The PCA9685 generates PWM signals for the servos, while I2C provides communication between the Raspberry Pi, the manual-input ADC, the IMU, and the actuator driver layer.

> **Exact connection mapping:** see [`docs/hardware_connections.md`](docs/hardware_connections.md).  
> This document is the source of truth for physical Raspberry Pi pin numbers, I2C wiring, GPIO interrupt pins, servo channel assignments, potentiometer wiring, and shared-ground requirements.

---

## Running

### Core CLI Application

#### Linux

```bash
./build/solar_tracker
```

#### Typical Windows Location

```text
build\Release\solar_tracker.exe
```

### Software-Only Mode

The software-only path uses a simulated camera backend and a non-hardware actuator path for development and testing without the physical platform.

### Optional Qt GUI Application

Built only when Qt support is enabled and found:

```bash
./build/solar_tracker_qt
```

#### Typical Windows Location

```text
build\Release\solar_tracker_qt.exe
```

### Hardware Mode

Hardware execution requires:

- libcamera support for the live camera path
- I2C enabled on the host
- PCA9685 connected correctly
- servo power and wiring connected correctly

The system enters `FAULT` if required startup steps fail or mandatory hardware is unavailable.

### Runtime Latency Capture

```bash
./scripts/run_latency.sh
```

This writes latency data to:

```text
artefacts/latency.csv
```

For a fuller command reference, see [`docs/build_and_run.md`](docs/build_and_run.md).

## Realtime Evidence

The measured software-side pipeline is:

**Camera → FrameQueue → SunTracker → Controller → ManualImuCoordinator → Kinematics3RRS → ActuatorManager → ServoDriver**

All measurements are taken using monotonic timestamps recorded inside the software pipeline and exported to `artefacts/latency.csv`.

### Latency Results

| Metric | Average (ms) | Minimum (ms) | Maximum (ms) | Jitter (ms) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| L_total | 8.369570 | 6.829599 | 14.565364 | 7.735765 |
| L_vision | 8.242496 | 6.755912 | 14.530086 | 7.774174 |
| L_control | 0.014822 | 0.006038 | 0.363637 | 0.357599 |
| L_actuation | 0.112253 | 0.019426 | 3.095969 | 3.076543 |

### Interpretation

- average end-to-end software latency is approximately **8.37 ms**
- worst-case measured software latency is approximately **14.57 ms**
- measured timing remains below a typical **30 Hz** frame period of approximately **33 ms**
- measurements represent the userspace software path only, not full physical actuator motion or mechanical settling time
